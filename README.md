# thesis
This git repo contains the main scripts used inside the WSL environment where MBDyn was installed.
It spans several folders each of which is used in a different chapt of the thesis titled:
A Comparative Study of the Impact of Innovative Lead-lag Damping Configurations on Helicopter Rotor Stability and Loads
## Folders
1. GR_MBDyn
    Chapter 1: Ideal multi-body simulation of ground resonance
2. GR_AERO
    Chapter 3: Influence of aerodynamics and out-of-plane motions on ground resonance stability
3. AERO_MBDyn
    Chapter 4: Loads in forward flight
    * KINCUP
        TODO
2. FRICTION
    Chapter 5: Implementation and analysis of non-linear elastomeric dampers
